        <h1>A little about me:</h1>
        <article>
          <img src="images/jaylen2.jpg" alt="Jaylen Mullins" width="310" height="539" />
          <p> I was born in San Diego, thus the logo being San Diego, in a little town called Escondido in April of 2002.</p>

          <p>I then moved to West Virgina at the age of 3 where my younger brother Amir was born. We then would proceed to move to Illinois in 2005, where I have stayed since then!</p>

          <p> Currently, I am apart of the Trinity Chritian Men's Basketball program, pursuing my dream of becoming a professional overseas player in the next comming years. I'm currently studying Computer Science, with a minor in mathmatics. The reason I chose to become a computer science major is my dad has a bachelor's degree in Electric Engineering and he codes robotic arms for a car manufactor plant. So I thought, "Hey, Let's just code in general."</p>

          <p>In the Future, I would like to have my masters degree, including various amounts of certifications for different different coding methods to make me stand out. Including, hopefully still playing basketball at a high level.</p>
